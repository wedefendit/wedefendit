/**
 * Room → zone pre-assignments per difficulty tier.
 *
 * - Easy: every room is pre-tagged with a zone so the player only places devices.
 * - Medium: the most intuitive rooms are pre-tagged, rest are blank (null).
 * - Hard: nothing is pre-tagged — the player assigns every zone and every device.
 *
 * A `null` value means the player must assign the zone for that room.
 *
 * Note: the Guest zone intentionally has no dedicated room — Guest is a network
 * concept rather than a physical space. The renderer / UI layer exposes a
 * separate "Guest Network" drop target alongside the rooms.
